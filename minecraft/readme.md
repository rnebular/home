# Containerized version of Minecraft server

## NONE OF THIS IS FUNCTIONING YET! ##

To start the container (I hope):

docker run -it rnebular/minecraft_server:latest

To test the container, you could run it with a bash shell open:

docker run --it rnebular/minecraft_server:latest /bin/bash

# Hopefully this will all work, as I hate to admin my own virtual instance.
